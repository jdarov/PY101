# In this code, we define a function with two paramaters string and value. The invocation implements a while loop,
# but this while loop has no practical use as True is always truthy and break will always break the loop. 

# string is called from the paramaters and will be assigned to a new object value. 

# Since this is in the local scope and the invocation doesnt return any value, this function will simply not work as expected

# global variable greet is assigned a string 'Hey', the function replace is called with arg greeting, "Hello). 
# As discussed this function has no logical purpose
# print(greet) will output the object greet is point to which in this case is the string 'Hey'
